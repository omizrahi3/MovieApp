* **Awesome Movie Page** — Each movie has it's own individual page that contains movie rating system, comment system and purchase system.
	* Rating System - Registered users can leave a score between 1 to 5.
	* Comment System - Registered users can comment on the movie and reply to comments as well as like or dislike comments.
	* Purchase System - Registered users can purchase movie with adequate funds in account. ***Note: Because app is in dev mode, no full length movies are being purchased. "Purchasing" movies will instead give user access to publicly available trailers.***

* **Individualized Dashboard** — Registered users will have access to their personal dashboard page. Dashboard page includes account information, Stripe payment option to increase balance, and access to all previously "purchased" movies. ***Note: Stripe API is in TEST mode. Do not enter actual credit card information, instead enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 to make payment.***

* **Movie Viewer** — Once "purchased", users will have access to movie viewer to watch "purchased" movie.***Note: Because app is for demo purposes only, users will have access to publicly available trailers.***
